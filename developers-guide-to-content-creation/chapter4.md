# Guided Exercise #9 - Abstract Worksheet
Title: Rust & Svelte: Part 1 - Hello World    

Abstract: This blog will be a show and tell on how to glue together Rust and Frontend code using Web Assembly.
I happen to be using Svelte, but it can be done with any Frontend framework or just JavaScript.  The purpose
is to give a gentle introduction on how it's done with a Hello World example.

Prerequistes:
* A little Rust
* A little JavaScript
* Some familiarity with the commandline

Takeaways: The reader should be able to read a variable that was set in Rust and display it in their browser console or web page.

Next Steps:  Send input from the front end to the Rust code.
