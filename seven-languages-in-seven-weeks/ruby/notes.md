#Ruby Notes:

##Day 1

unless
until

one line if statements, good or bad?
```
puts "This is true is x equals 4" if x == 4
```

0 is true!!

##Day 2

A code block is a function without a name.
`3.times {puts 'this is a code block'}`

```
3.times do
  puts 'this is also a code block (do/end)'
  puts 'This is the convention of multiline blocks.'
end
```
Does not support multiple inheritance like C++.
Ruby modules are like interfaces with default implementations.
